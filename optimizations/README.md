# CS57 Compiler Optimizations

## Rohan Kartha (rohankartha)

### Description

`optimizations` performs the optimization of the *LLVM Intermediate Representation* generated in `IR Builder`.  Specifically, this module performs three local optimizations – (1) *common subexpression elimination*; (2) *dead code elimination*; (3) *constant folding* – and one global optimization – *constant propagation*. `optimizations` accepts a `.ll` file generated by `clang` as input and returns an optimized IR `.ll` file as output.
